## Project Setup

### Submitting Your Work

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Go to your project's repository.
   - Click on the 'Branches' tab or use the command line:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```
   - Choose a unique branch name (e.g., `feature/new-page`).

2. **Complete and Test Your Page:**
   - Ensure your page is fully completed.
   - Test it thoroughly to make sure there are no bugs.

3. **Submit a Pull Request:**
   - Push your branch to the repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```
   - Create a pull request (PR) in the repository.
   - Make sure to select your branch for the PR.

4. **Code Review:**
   - Your code will be reviewed by the team.
   - Address any feedback and make necessary adjustments.

5. **Local Development Changes:**
   - If you made changes for local development (e.g., API endpoints, configurations), remember to revert these changes before submitting your pull request. This ensures the code works correctly in production.

## Styling Guidelines

- **Responsive Design:** 
  - Ensure all components work well on both mobile devices and larger screens.
  - Use flexible layouts with `flex` and `grid`. Avoid using fixed sizes like pixels.
  - Utilize classes like `justify-center`, `justify-between`, and `items-center` for proper alignment and spacing.

- **Consistency:** 
  - Refer to the [HomePage](#) for a clean and consistent code structure.

- **Component Usage:**
  - Use ShadCN components for buttons, inputs, and other UI elements. Check the [ShadCN Docs](https://ui.shadcn.dev) for usage details.

## Adding Pages

1. **Update the List of Pages:**
   - Open `@lib/ListOfPages.tsx`.
   - Add your new page with its name and path:
     ```typescript
     { name: 'Your Page Name', path: '/your-page-path' }
     ```

2. **Add a Route:**
   - Open `app.tsx`.
   - Define the route for your page:
     ```tsx
     <Route path="/your-page-path" element={<YourPageComponent />} />
     ```

## Server-Side Development

1. **Creating a New Route:**

   - **Create or Update Controller:** 
     - Add your function in `controllers` (e.g., `userController.ts` or `authController.ts`).
     - Example:
       ```typescript
       export const myFunction = async (req, res) => {
           res.status(200).json({ message: 'Success' });
       };
       ```

   - **Update Routes:**
     - Add your route in `routes` (e.g., `authRoutes.ts` or `userRoutes.ts`).
     - Example:
       ```typescript
       router.post('/my-endpoint', myControllerFunction);
       ```

   - **Secure Routes with Middleware:**
     - Example:
       ```typescript
       router.get('/secure-endpoint', verifyToken, secureControllerFunction);
       ```

   - **Integrate Routes:**
     - Add your routes to `app.js`:
       ```javascript
       app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
       ```

2. **Configure Axios and Prisma for Local Development:**

   - **Axios:**
     - Edit `/client/lib/axiosinstance.tsx` to use your local server URL:
       ```typescript
       const axiosInstance = axios.create({
           baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080',
           headers: { 'x-access-token': localStorage.getItem("token") },
       });
       ```

   - **Prisma:**
     - Edit `/server/prisma/Prisma.js` to use your local database configuration:
       ```javascript
       const prisma = new PrismaClient();
       ```

   - **Important:** Remember to revert these changes before submitting your pull request to ensure everything works correctly in production.

## Form Handling

1. **Type-Safe Forms with React Hook Form and Zod:**

   - **Setup:**
     - Use `react-hook-form` and `zod` to manage form state and validation.
     - Example form setup:
       ```typescript
       import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
       import { z } from 'zod';
       import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';

       const userSchema = z.object({
           firstName: z.string().min(3).max(25),
           lastName: z.string().min(3).max(25),
           email: z.string().email(),
           password: z.string().min(8),
           confirmPassword: z.string().min(1),
       }).refine(data => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
           message: "Passwords do not match",
           path: ["confirmPassword"],
       });

       type UserFormValues = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;

       export default function SignUpForm() {
           const form = useForm<UserFormValues>({ resolver: zodResolver(userSchema) });
           // form handling code
       }
       ```

## General Information & Best Practices

1. **Code Cleanliness:**
   - Write clean, readable, and well-organized code.
   - Follow existing project conventions and structure.

2. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test your pages and server routes to ensure they work as expected.

3. **Security:**
   - Avoid sending sensitive information like passwords to the frontend.
   - Ensure that sensitive data is properly sanitized and handled on the server.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document your code clearly.
   - Update this README with any new instructions or guidelines as needed.

By following these guidelines, youâ€™ll contribute effectively to the Allcode Community Project and help maintain a high-quality development environment for everyone involved.
